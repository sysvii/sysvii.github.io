## Self Q&A introduction-thingy

No blog website is complete without some kind of a self-introduction and lucky
for you it is right here on the landing page!

If you were looking for the [list of post(s) it is here](@/posts/_index.md)

Anyway, so here we go:

### Who am I?

Great question, I would like to know as well. For what I do know

I get paid to tap on the computers, it has been ride so far & I have it on good
authority that ride never ends. Though it strangely always ends with a cabin in
the woods...

So far I've had to very _professionally_ deal with these headaches:
 * big AWS, with lot of enterprise
 * _Cyber_ Security, mainly in the cloud department with some application stuff
 * Identity & Access management with too many people
 * shoving code where it should & should not go

Weirdly enough those will probably be the main topics of this place.

### What to expect?

A scale of writing ability that goes from stream of thoughts to
academia report due tomorrow.
I won't delude any expectations that it is any good but at least I've
had some fun writing it.

### Why have a in blog in the good year of {{ current_year }}?!

It is what all the cool cats do these days and I wanted to be apart of the cool
crowd this time.

### What do I really want this for?

Really, my goal is to record some of my learnings so that others might be
able to share the pain, save some time or even (big dream here) teach someone
something.

I am aware my main audience is myself in 5 months when I forget what I
did in my old-er age & am going through the pain again but that's not too bad IMO (you're doing great future me).

## Big Thanks You

No one can get to where they are today with help. For me, I would never
be able to make this site without these cool people, so big thanks to:

     is made with.

 * And [You](https://love-live.fandom.com/wiki/You_Watanabe) <!-- best girl --> too,
     for spending your time & data to see, read, wish you didn't then laugh at this meta text.

Also shout outs to some cool people:

## How to report a wrong

I'm a human, at least that is what the capatcha leads me to believe, therefore
I err. If there is anything you feel like that should be corrected @ me on the
socials at the top of this page and I'll do my best to correct it.
